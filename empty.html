    <h1>Class 6: Calculate the vote results for NY with Kamala Harris</h1>
    <h2>Goal: Calculate voting percentage and determine which candidate won and by what margin. It should look like this:</h2>
    <code>Kamala Harris won New York with 56.4% of the vote, about 13 points more than Donald Trump, who had 43.6%.</code>
    <h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll need to format the numbers a bit -- there's a powerful tool called <code>.ToFixed()</code> in Javascript you can use to round numbers</li>
        <li>You have all the data needed, but you need to figure out which variables to do and how to calculate it</li>
    </ul>
     <script>
        //Votes
        const kamalaVotes = '4583210';
        const trumpVotes = '3548552';
        
        //Convert the Numbers

        let converted_number_kamala = Number(kamalaVotes);
        let converted_number_trump = Number(trumpVotes);

        //Write a function to calculate the share of votes each candidate got and save it to variables

        function calculateVotes(){
            console.log(converted_number_kamala/(converted_number_kamala+converted_number_trump) *100);
            console.log(converted_number_trump/(converted_number_kamala+converted_number_trump)*100);
        }
        calculateVotes()
        //Write a console.log that prints out a message of the result
        
        function winner(winner, percentage, loser, percentage2){
            
        }
